1. **PID Controller** (temperature regulation)
2. **ThermalSystem** (physics simulation)
3. **Safety Monitor** (safety oversight and emergency overrides)

### Integration Requirements
- Safety monitor should override PID controller in emergency situations
- Clean API for external systems to interact with complete control system
- Proper coordination between control loops and safety checks
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for complete control stack

- Performance validation under various conditions
- Safety validation with fault injection

## Project Context for AI Assistant

When helping me:
1. **Understand this is safety-critical** - Medical applications require high reliability
2. **Maintain the modular architecture** - Clean interfaces between components
3. **Follow the established patterns** - Consistent with existing code style and structure
4. **Consider FDA compliance** - Medical device development standards
5. **Comprehensive testing** - Every feature needs thorough validation

I have a solid foundation and just need help with the integration layer to complete the control system. The thermal physics and individual control components are working perfectly - now I need to coordinate them into a unified system.

## Quick Reference - Key Files and Functions

### Thermal System Interface
```python
thermal_system = ThermalSystem(blood_product, container_material, volume, mass)
current_temp = thermal_system.get_current_temperature()
actual_power = thermal_system.apply_thermal_power(power_command)
new_state = thermal_system.step(dt=10.0)
```

### PID Controller Interface  
```python
controller = create_blood_storage_controller(target_temp=4.0)
power_output = controller.update(current_temp, dt=10.0)
status = controller.get_status()
```

### Safety Monitor Interface
```python
safety_monitor = SafetyMonitor(blood_product)
safety_status = safety_monitor.update_temperature(current_temp)
emergency_power = safety_monitor.get_safety_override_power()
```

This system represents a complete medical-grade thermal control solution with the integration layer as the final piece needed for a production-ready system.
