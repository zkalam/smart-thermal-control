# Smart Thermal Control

A Python-based temperature control system that keeps medical equipment at the perfect temperature using smart algorithms and real-time monitoring.

## Project Overview

This system automatically controls temperature for medical devices like:

- Insulin coolers and medication storage
- Portable medical sensors
- Temperature-sensitive diagnostic equipment
- Medical transport containers

Think of it as a super-smart thermostat that's precise enough for medical applications
