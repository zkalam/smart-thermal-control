# Smart Thermal Control

A Python-based temperature control system specifically for blood storage applications, ensuring optimal storage conditions for life-saving blood products through intelligent monitoring and control algorithms.

## Project Overview

This system provides automated, precise temperature control for critical blood storage scenarios including:

- Blood Banks & Hospitals: Whole blood and red blood cell storage (1-6°C)
- Plasma Centers: Fresh frozen plasma storage (-18°C or below)
- Mobile Blood Units: Temperature-controlled transport containers
- Emergency Medical Services: Portable blood storage for field operations
- Research Facilities: Temperature-sensitive blood component storage

Think of it as a medical-grade smart thermostat with the precision and reliability required for life-critical blood storage applications.
